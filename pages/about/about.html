      What is the connection between METs and calories?
      </ion-card-title>
    <p text-justify>
If you know the MET value of a particular activity, you can figure out how many calories youâ€™re
burning.
The formula to use is:
METs x 3.5 x (your body weight in kilograms) / 200 = calories burned per minute.
For example, say you weigh 73 kg. and you singles tennis, which has a MET value of 8.
The formula would work as follows:
8 x 3.5 x 73 / 200 = 10.22 calories per minute.
If you play tennis for an hour, you will burn about 613.20 calories.

      Formula
      </ion-card-title>
    <p text-justify>
    To calculate the weight loss, we need to know how much energy our fat tissue contains - there
are approximately 7700 calories stored in every kilogram of body fat. So once you have found the
number of burned calories, all you have to do is to divide by 7700 to obtain the weight loss in kilograms:
    </p>
    <p> weight loss = calories/7700 </p>
